**AttorneyTech** was designed for lawyers, integrates Apple's Vision, EventKit, and Core Location frameworks to streamline court appointment scheduling. The Vision Framework's OCR technology efficiently scans legal documents, extracting critical information. This data is seamlessly integrated into the Apple Calendar using EventKit, facilitating easy addition of court dates. Core Location's intelligent scheduling feature then assesses the proximity of scheduled court appointments, alerting lawyers to any potential time conflicts due to travel between locations. This integration aids lawyers in efficiently managing their court appearances and optimizing their schedules.
